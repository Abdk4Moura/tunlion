"""Filament transport-UPGRADE model checker.

The third proof. `establishment_model.py` proves signaling reaches CONNECTED.
`transport_lifecycle_model.py` proves a CONNECTED pair can carry a file and tear
down cleanly. Both are green, and both were green through every defect below,
because each models a SINGLE transport slot. The upgrade -- two paths, one of
them destroyed in order to try the other -- is not representable in either, so
neither can see this layer at all. A clean run from an instrument that cannot
represent the fault is not evidence, and this file exists because we spent three
days reading one as if it were.

WHAT THIS MODELS

After the PAKE ceremony a pair holds an authenticated WebRTC link. The code then
tries to upgrade to direct QUIC ("Option A"): it DROPS the WebRTC link and races
a direct dial, intending to rebuild WebRTC if the race is lost.

    main.rs, both Option A call sites:
        conn.drop_link(&from);
        conn.start_direct(&from, &from, &sec).await;

Destroying a working transport in order to try a faster one has no precedent in
any comparable system (Happy Eyeballs, MPTCP, QUIC connection migration, and
Tailscale's DERP->direct upgrade all build the candidate ALONGSIDE and switch
only once it is proven). The gap it opens is acknowledged in the code comment
itself as a "bounded ~5s gap for NAT-blocked peers".

Six separate fixes over three days were each a way of making that gap smaller:

    PR #71   reorder establish() so its fallible work precedes the drop
    #71      carry expected_secret across the rebuild
    #78/#79  DirectIntent::Promote, so the drop happens after direct_pending
             is registered rather than before
    open     direct_pending.remove ahead of a bind_endpoint failure that
             returns 100 lines before the pending is re-registered
    #71      sync-digest roster reconciliation, which turned out to be
             REPAIRING the gap rather than serving its stated purpose
    open     the macOS regression in #78/#79

They are one defect. This model makes the defect a state predicate instead of
six patches, and checks the alternative design for the same predicate.

THE THREE DESIGNS

    EAGER    drop the WebRTC link, THEN attempt direct.          (main today)
    LATE     attempt direct, drop only after direct_pending is
             registered; a disabled or unbindable direct drops
             nothing at all.                                     (#78 / #79)
    PATHSET  never drop anything. Build the candidate alongside,
             promote by selecting it once it is LIVE, retire the
             old path only after the new one carries traffic.    (proposed)

THE FREE PARAMETER, AND WHY IT IS FREE

`ctrl_carries` is defined OBSERVATIONALLY, and the wording matters:

    can a transfer COMPLETE over the post-PAKE link without that link first
    being destroyed and rebuilt?

Not "does the link have a transport". The distinction is deliberate, because two
readings fit the evidence and they are not distinguished here:

    A  the retained link genuinely cannot carry data
    B  the link is fine, and the SENDER never progresses, because it waits on a
       state transition that only a rebuild emits

Both produce a transfer that never completes, which is what this model needs.
They imply very different fixes, so the model must not be read as asserting A.
The discriminator (claude-advisor's): did the sender ever ATTEMPT to send file
data on the retained link? Attempted-and-stalled is A; never-attempted is B.

CONFIRMED FALSE, by artifact, not by fit. Gate 0 derives ctrl_carries=False from
four CI outcomes, which is four points against one free bit and would be a fit as
much as a derivation. It is independently confirmed from the green `main` macOS
artifact of run 30825113095 (job 91724637129): sender peer xKm57McGHTIu6h-mAAAD
drops at the Option A site (main.rs:10871) after auth, ICE closes, a second
gather opens a new host port 57792, and the sha256 delivery success appears only
AFTER that rebuild. The green path rides a rebuilt link.

    Link { peer: Option<Arc<Peer>>, transport: Option<Arc<dyn Transport>>, .. }

`peer` is the WebRTC connection the PAKE rode; `transport` is the data plane and
is independently `None` until a data channel opens (main.rs:6614 builds a link
with `transport: None`). Which of A or B that reflects is still open.

VALIDATION GATE

Before this model is permitted to make any claim, it must reproduce all four
outcomes observed in CI on 2026-08-03. An instrument that cannot reproduce the
results we already have is not trusted with the ones we do not. If the gate
fails, the run exits non-zero and prints the mismatch: the model is wrong, not
the observation.

    # exists, and gate 0 must be re-derived against post-fix CI.
