"""Exhaustive model check for the capability ledger (CONTRACT.md laws L1-L18).
L14-L18 arrived as review rulings and the contract now declares them; the guard
maps every declared law to a check key in this file, so text and model cannot
drift apart in either direction. See `source_guard`.

Same discipline as establishment_model.py and fleet_automesh_model.py:
enumerate the ENTIRE op space of a bounded universe, then assert every law over
every cell, not over a trace we happened to hit. Exhaustive over a bounded
model is a definitive result FOR THAT BOUND.

WHAT IS MODELLED
----------------
An append-only log of signed ops and the pure verdict function over it.

  Op      (id, author, subject, action, resource, nb, na, kind, version, ref,
           min_binding)
          interval is half-open [nb, na); `ref` is the referenced op id on an
          Accept and None elsewhere; `min_binding` is the strength of identity
          binding the op REQUIRES for an allow it supports -- "proven" by
          default, "inferred" only on a Grant (the pair-secret legacy
          population), which is what gives the migration switch a home (L16).
          It is part of the op, so the author's signature covers it exactly as it
          covers kind and interval.
  kinds   grant | deny | ceiling | pass | pause | accept
          `certify` is NOT here: per review ruling 2 it is an identity-lifecycle
          event, not a ledger op, and its result reaches the evaluator as
          Facts.cert (law L15). `pass` IS an op (law L14).
  Facts   now, subject, binding, cert, held_author_key, ops (pre-verified)
  Request (action, resource) -- a CONCRETE claim, daemon-derived
  Verdict (decision, reason, valid_until, because)

Universe: two keys used in BOTH the author and the subject role (a self-grant
and a cross-grant are both expressible, and an Accept can be authored by the
wrong key so L13 can fail), three capability PATTERNS over a small resource
lattice (shell@*, forward@ws:8080, forward@ws:*), three concrete REQUESTS that
those patterns cover differently (shell@dev:a, forward@ws:8080,
forward@ws:9090), intervals over a small integer clock, and every time step
that is an interval boundary or a neighbour of one (nb-1, nb, na-1, na).

No single tier carries the whole universe: each tier is exhaustive over the
dimensions its laws need and pinned on the ones they do not, so the product
stays inside a ten-second budget. The tier banner prints each bound.

TIERS
the original eight (CORE, DEPTH, VER, PAIR, ORDER, SCOPE, INGEST, FACTS) plus
one per law the review added: PASS (L14), CERT (L15), BIND (L16), HELD (L17),
COMPACT (L18). FACTS changed direction rather than growing: it used to assert
that every Facts field was irrelevant, and now asserts that the three fields the
rulings made load-bearing ARE load-bearing, and that display_name is not.

WHAT IS *NOT* MODELLED
----------------------
- Signatures, key agreement, or any cryptography. `sig_ok` is a boolean input
  to ingest; the evaluator never sees it, which is exactly L6's claim.
- Tiers (external / paired / fleet / dormant / paused). CONTRACT.md states they
  are CLI-computed views over verdicts and facts and are never stored, so there
  is nothing here to model. Modelling them would create state the contract says
  does not exist.
- Forget. It is a STORAGE action, not an op: it removes a record and its ops.
  Its effect on a verdict is exactly "evaluate the smaller log", which every
  tier below already enumerates.
- The current Rust engine's shadow/authoritative split, its counters, and the
  cap-flip migration. This models the contract, not the transition to it.
- Wall-clock arithmetic, timezones, leap seconds. `now` is an integer.

READING CHOICES (stated, not silently resolved)
-----------------------------------------------
Three points in the approved design are under-constrained. Each is pinned here
to the most conservative reading consistent with L1-L13, and named in
CONTRACT.md under "Deliberately unresolved" rather than quietly decided:

  Certify   NOT AN OP ANY MORE (review ruling 2). Certification is an
            identity-lifecycle event whose result reaches the evaluator as
            Facts.cert; law L15 is the law that reads it. There is therefore
            nothing to ingest, contribute to a verdict, or explain.
  Pass      an op, and a SPECIES OF GRANT (review ruling 2): a Grant whose
            subject is a person key with a device budget, attenuable by that
            subject for its own device keys, and never wider than the author's
            own ceiling toward that resource (attenuation-only, the Biscuit
            property). Who may pass = any key that holds the capability it
            passes, so a pass whose author holds nothing covering it is INERT
            rather than merely narrow. Law L14.
  Pause     scoped by its own capability pattern, so "every allow the author
            would give" is every allow WITHIN that pattern. A pause at the top
            of the lattice is the wholesale reading (review ruling 7).

  Facts     which Facts fields the verdict may read is no longer "none".
            Rulings 2/3 make three of them load-bearing: cert (L15), binding
            (L16) and held_author_key (L17). A field that no law reads is a
            dead input, so tier FACTS now asserts RELEVANCE for those three and
            irrelevance only for display_name, and the vacuity gate fails if a
            field is never load-bearing.

L10's plain-English form ("ops that each deny never combine into an allow") is
contradicted by L5, whose entire mechanism is a Grant and an Accept -- each
denying alone -- allowing together. Tier PAIR checks the restricted form and
requires that single exception to be the ONLY one, failing on any second
(review ruling 1: the (Grant, its referenced Accept) pair is THE defined
widening, and any second widening route must break the run).

GATE 0
------
Before any law is reported, the model reproduces behaviour the deployed gate
already has, taken from the oracle rows of
`exec_matches_pty_across_gate_matrix` in cli/src/shell_gate.rs and from
CONTRACT.md's SSH-certificate rules. What has NO analogue today (deny, pause
and accept are new primitives; `CapOpKind` is Grant | Revoke | Modify and
Revoke DELETES the row) is listed as new rather than claimed as reproduced.
