// ============================================================================
// LIVENESS state machine: the data-flow phase of ONE link carrying an in-flight
// transfer, as seen by the bytes-moved stall watchdog.
//
// Why a machine: the watchdog's job is "no data for too long -> correct", but
// "too long" is NOT one number. A link that is still ESTABLISHING (TURN alloc +
// ICE + DTLS/SCTP + first chunk, which over a high-RTT relay routinely takes
// 10-30 s) has not earned the tight flowing-transfer threshold yet; charging it
// that threshold tore the link down and rebuilt it, and the rebuild re-exceeded
// the threshold -> an infinite repair loop that delivered ZERO bytes (the exact
// hang the watchdog exists to prevent). The fix is to make the timeout a
// property OF THE PHASE: this enum names the phases, and `classify` is the ONLY
// place a phase is paired with a clock, so "judge an establishing link by the
// flowing threshold" is unrepresentable.
//
// The phases and their allowed transitions (driven each watchdog tick by the
// observation `LiveObs` = in-flight? transport-up? first-byte-flowed? idle-ms):
