//! Ratchet on platform-conditional code outside `platform/`. See
//! docs/architecture/PLATFORM.md.
//!
//! The rule: platform differences live in `platform/`; everything else calls a
//! portable function. We had that structure and routed around it. At the time
//! this landed there were 254 platform-conditional blocks in cli/src and only
//! 40 were in `platform/`; main.rs alone had 97.
//!
//! That is not tidiness. #204 (daemon_alive read /proc inline, constant-false on
//! Windows, three features silently dead), #215 (detach_up's Windows arm
//! computes the log path and discards it) and #205 (ctl.rs unix-only, so bounded
//! invitations cannot be claimed when minted on Windows) are all the same
//! mistake: a platform fact written where it was needed, tested on the platform
//! the author had, wrong elsewhere for an unknown number of releases.
//!
//! A ratchet, not a wall: 214 sites are grandfathered and the number may only go
//! down. A test that is red on day one gets deleted rather than paid.
//!
//! `platform/` is exempt. That is what it is for.
