# Shared hermetic-gate fixture. Source this from a gate script (which must set
# PORT, SERVER, WORK, BIN, CLI_DIR, PYV, DA before sourcing), then call the
# helpers below. See mount-revoke-gates.sh / pty-revoke-gates.sh /
# l2-revoke-gates.sh for the pattern.
#
# `FILAMENT_L2=1` on the acceptor is baked into `start_acceptor`, not left to the
# caller, because pty-open / mount-open / l2-open are all gated on `l2_enabled`
# and a plain `up` leaves it off with a failure that is silent on both sides.

# --- Preconditions and refusal ---
# A HARNESS THAT CANNOT DISTINGUISH "the code is broken" from "the box cannot
# hold the build" MUST REFUSE TO REPORT, with an exit code distinct from both
# pass and fail. Assert your preconditions (free space, a warm toolchain, a free
# port, a writable temp dir) BEFORE measuring, and when one is unmet print a
# single line naming it instead of a result -- a result produced under a broken
# precondition is indistinguishable from a defect and will be read as one.
# There is no exit code that means "probably fine".
#
# Reference implementation: `scripts/flake-check.sh` (exit 0 = clean, 1 = a real
# failure, 3 = refused). A full disk once made a test target report 20/20
# failures that looked like product defects, with the only tell a single
# `No space left on device` line nothing was watching for.

# --- assertion bookkeeping ---

# A gate whose failure is a NAMED, TRACKED defect rather than a regression.
# Same philosophy as gates-ratchet.sh: a still-broken gate does not fail the
# build (it was already broken and this job is not where that is discovered),
# but the list only ever SHRINKS -- a known-red gate that starts passing fails
# the run so the entry gets removed in the same commit, with evidence.
#
# Usage: declare KNOWN_RED_ALLOW=( "<substring of the FAIL text>" ... ) in the
# gate script, and end with `declare_known_red_summary`; see
# fleet-cert-gates.sh's AUTH-A for the worked example.
# Entries are "<pass-text>|<fail-text>" pairs, following gates-ratchet.sh: a
# gate almost never announces failure under the name it announces success, so a
# single substring cannot tell "it passed" from "it never ran".

# --- certified fleet pair (two daemons, real enrolment) ----------------------

# on disk but no daemon behind it, and it asserts nothing about whether either
# end actually RESOLVED an identity. Both matter for any gate about
# certificates, because a secret-paired link resolves no identity at all, so
# `cert_revoked_for(None)` is false there and a cert-revocation gate written on
# such a link passes whatever the product does. The two helpers below close
# that: one brings the spoke's own daemon up (the product topology is two
# daemons, not a daemon plus a one-shot client), the other asserts the
# certified relationship BEFORE any gate leans on it.
