# --- certified fleet pair (two daemons, real enrolment) ----------------------
#
# `enroll_delegate` above stops at the join: it leaves the spoke's certificate
# on disk but no daemon behind it, and it asserts nothing about whether either
# end actually RESOLVED an identity. Both matter for any gate about
# certificates, because a secret-paired link resolves no identity at all, so
# `cert_revoked_for(None)` is false there and a cert-revocation gate written on
# such a link passes whatever the product does. The two helpers below close
# that: one brings the spoke's own daemon up (the product topology is two
# daemons, not a daemon plus a one-shot client), the other asserts the
# certified relationship BEFORE any gate leans on it.
