# Ratchet for the deterministic core (#249 item 1, #34).
#
# gates.sh does not currently pass in full: at the time of writing 12 of 22
# report PASS and the rest have named, tracked causes. Two dishonest ways to get
# a green tick from that were rejected:
#
#   continue-on-error  a step that reports success while proving nothing, which
#                      is the exact defect #249 exists to fix
#   a pass-count floor a run can hit "12 passed" with a DIFFERENT twelve, so the
#                      number says nothing about which behaviour still holds
#
# Instead this asserts, by name, that every gate KNOWN to work still works. A
# regression in any of them fails the build. A still-broken gate does not,
# because it was already broken and this job is not where that gets discovered.
#
# When a red gate is repaired, add it to EXPECTED_GREEN in the same commit. The
# list only ever grows; that is the ratchet. Removing an entry needs a reason in
# the commit message, because it means a behaviour that used to hold no longer
# does.
#
# MEASURE THE LIST WHERE THE RATCHET RUNS. The first version of this list was
# measured on the do-vm host and asserted against GitHub runners, and one gate
# differed: "kill-resume: replacement receiver resumed" passes locally and fails
# on a runner. It is deliberately NOT in the list below. The kill half works
# there (the .part reached 20336640 bytes, so the gate's premise held); it is
# the resume half that does not, which makes it environment-sensitive rather
# than deterministic by construction, and an environment-sensitive gate in this
# list makes the job fail for reasons that are not regressions.
#
# It is a candidate to add back once it is understood, not a gate to quietly
# drop. Tracked in #249.
#
# Matching is on a stable SUBSTRING of each gate's ok() text, deliberately not
# the whole line: some carry a measured value ("22.8 MB/s") that varies per run,
# and pinning those would make this fail for the wrong reason.

# failure indistinguishable from a gate that never ran, and every red here was
# reported as though the gate had vanished. Carrying both labels is what lets
# this say FAILED when the gate failed.
