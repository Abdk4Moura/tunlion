# Livelock gate for #246: the relay fallback must never drop a link that is
# still establishing.
#
# The gate is DIAGNOSTIC and owned (see .github/executable-artifacts.json).
# It is not wired to CI: nothing in .github/workflows runs cli/tests/*-gates.sh,
# and this gate cannot be required until its lab is committed. Register the
# wt-hp2 lab (/root/wt-hp2/lab: netns + real coturn STUN/TURN + two NAT routers
# + netem) with the repo before promoting this to `required`. The #247 rule: a
# gate whose instrument lives outside the repo rots the moment the directory
# does, and a gate that cannot run must be a failure, not a silent skip.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE COVERS
#  - The #246 hazard is a condition on the ladder, not a networking failure:
#    start_direct must never drop a WebRTC link whose peer is still making
#    progress (Peer::is_live: anything but Failed/Closed), and a Normal re-dial
#    must never arm a fresh direct pending while such a link exists. Those
#    invariants are enforced and UNIT-TESTED here (L1,
#    link_dead_and_live_predicates_encode_246, deterministic, runs in cargo
#    test). The unit test is the deterministic home of this gate.
#  - End-to-end (L3): on the remapping cone topology with netem delay+loss a
#    build that violates the invariants shows non-establishment trials, and
#    this build does not. The fixture reproduces the race occasionally on an
#    idle box (2026-08-18: red binary 1/15 fail at delay=100ms loss=3%, 2/15
#    at loss=5%; ~100% under box load mid-teens, chief-ux's original 15/15)
#    and the netem pair is the run that shows it. The gate records the binary
#    sha and host load (LOT) next to every result so a number is never read
#    detached from the conditions that produced it.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT COVER (read before trusting green)
#  - The end-to-end kill's trigger is a queueing race: the peer's announce
#    train must still hold a start_direct-triggering event at the moment the
#    fallback's establish begins. On an idle box that alignment is rare; under
#    load it is ~certain. The netem pair therefore does NOT redden reliably on
#    an idle box, so it is not a pass/fail gate on the red side. The FIXED
#    side asserts the two mechanism signatures only: no fallback re-offer and
#    no link_dead killer drop. Delivery is reported beside the LOT, not
#    asserted: #252 is an independent C3 watchdog handoff race. The
#    deterministic red is the L1 unit test (first fix, it must fail and the
#    fixed predicate must pass).
#  - The boundary on "still live" is not proved here: New/Connecting are
#    bounded by the C3 establishment watchdog (WATCHDOG_SECS=15s, Ev::Stuck),
#    Disconnected by on_pc_state's grace timer (6s or away+15s,
#    Ev::GraceExpired), both generation-keyed. A regression of those timers
#    would not be caught by this gate.
#  - #252: at loss=3%, this fixture can hit the independent C3 watchdog race
#    (observed 1/15 on 2026-08-18): ICE reaches Connected, the C3 watchdog sees
#    PC Connecting and rebuilds, then the queued PC Connected event lands for
#    the torn-down link. That has neither a fallback re-offer nor a link_dead
#    killer signature, so delivery is context rather than a #246 verdict.
