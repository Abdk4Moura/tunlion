//! Ratchet on bare print macros. See docs/ui/OUTPUT.md.
//!
//! Human-facing output goes through `ui::say` / `ui::critical` / `ui::trace`,
//! which apply the verbosity gate, colour capability and glyph fallbacks.
//! `println!` is for stdout, machine-readable output that must NOT be gated.
//! `eprintln!` for human text is always wrong: it looks like UI, and under `-q`
//! it is the one thing still shouting.
//!
//! A wall would be useless here. There are 338 existing sites and a test that
//! is red on day one gets deleted, so this is a RATCHET: each file has a budget
//! and the number may only go down. Converting calls and lowering the budget in
//! the same commit is the intended way to pay it off.
//!
//! Concrete defect this guards, from the invitation screen: its body printed
//! with `eprintln!` and its footer with `ui::say`, so under `-q` the user got
//! the footer and not the invitation.
